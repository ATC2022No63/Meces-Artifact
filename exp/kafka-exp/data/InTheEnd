It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter
How hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by
As the pendulum swings
Watch it count down
To the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go
Right out the window
Trying to hold on
But didn't even know
Wasted it all just
To watch you go
I kept everything inside and
Even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will
Eventually be a
Memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing
I don't know why
It doesn’t even matter
How hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way
You were mocking me
Acting like I was
Part of your property
Remembering all the
Times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way
They were before
You wouldn't even
Recognize me anymore
Not that you
Knew me back then
But it all comes
Back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will
Eventually be a
Memory of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

It doesn't even matter
